# terms.dev

This is the source repository for [terms.dev](https://terms.dev), a website dedicated to one simple purpose: listing one, succinct definition for software terms. That's it!

Taking PRs! Happy to take suggestions which is why I made this site public.

Don't have time for that? Just tweet or DM me on Twitter ([@peakscale](https://twitter.com/peakscale)). No problem.

Thanks!
